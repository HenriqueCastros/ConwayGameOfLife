Mini project focused on developing [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).<br>
I developed the whole app using the basics of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).<br>

### Features to be developed
This project is still in development, there are upcoming updates still to be released. Following are the tasks I plan to implent:

- [x] Flexible game grid.
- [x] Grid's size picker with responsive max-size.
- [ ] Dark and light mode.
- [ ] Buttons that add certain pattern to the grid. I. e.: Spaceships, Oscillators, etc.
